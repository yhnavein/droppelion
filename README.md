Droppelion
==========

Droppelion is an Angular directive with sophisticated Typeahead / DropDown. It's not a wrapper around any jQuery plugin, so it can be used with just Angular and Bootstrap.

It has configurable templates, so it's really easy to apply custom styling.

git clone https://github.com/yhnavein/droppelion.git
