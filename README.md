Droppelion
==========

Droppelion is an Angular directive with sophisticated Typeahead / DropDown. It's not a wrapper around any jQuery plugin, so it can be used with just Angular and Bootstrap.

It has configurable templates, so it's really easy to apply custom styling.


## Starting and initial configuration

```
git clone https://github.com/yhnavein/droppelion.git
cd droppelion
npm install -d # -msvs_version=2013 if you have only VS2013 installed
bower install -d
node app
```
